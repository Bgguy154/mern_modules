              sharing food creates fun moments. A train journey is not just

          <p>
            Studying with hostelmates is both fun and productive. We share
            notes, discuss difficult topics, and motivate each other to stay
            focused. Group study sessions help in clearing doubts quickly and
            learning new perspectives. Besides academics, it strengthens
            friendships, builds teamwork, and creates a supportive environment
            for success and personal growth.
